In the atmospheric style of Remedios Varo meets contemporary poetic photography, blending magical realism with raw, emotional portraiture and textural depth where words become physical elements. A book cover framing with a centered, intimate composition, shot from a low angle to emphasize her resilience against the towering legacy. Chiaroscuro lighting with a stark contrast between warm amber embers and cold, ethereal blue moonlight, using a palette of deep indigo, burnt umber, ash gray, and flashes of poetic gold. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
